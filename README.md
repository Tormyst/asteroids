# asteroids
A version of asteroids done in c. 

This program was built using OpenGL for a class project for CSCI 3161 at dalhousie university.  

This version means to focus on vector graphics, trying to be similer to the atari version while trying to add additions of extra features.
The only color will be caused by hyperspace movement.
